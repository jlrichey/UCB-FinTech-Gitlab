    "# Steps to Backtest a Strategy/Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtesting a trading strategy or algorithm involves simulating its performance against historical data to assess its effectiveness and profitability. Below are the steps involved in conducting a backtest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Initial Investment:** Determine the initial capital that will be used to execute the trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up Volume of Shares:** Decide on the number of shares or volume that the strategy will trade with for each transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Position Column:** Create a column in your dataset to track the position of the stock. This column will contain the number of shares that the strategy is holding at any given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identify Entry/Exit Points:** Determine specific points in time when the strategy will buy or sell shares. This can be based on indicators, signals, or conditions defined by the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate Portfolio Holdings:** Calculate the dollar value of the shares held in the portfolio at each timestamp. This is also known as the portfolio holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate Portfolio Cash:** Determine the amount of cash available in the portfolio after each transaction. This accounts for buying and selling shares and any associated transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Track Portfolio Value:** Calculate the total value of the portfolio on a daily basis. This includes the combined value of the held stock and the available cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Calculate Portfolio Daily Returns:** Compute the daily returns of the portfolio based on changes in its value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Calculate Cumulative Returns:** Aggregate the daily returns to calculate the cumulative returns of the portfolio. This provides an overall measure of the strategy's performance over the backtesting period.\n"
